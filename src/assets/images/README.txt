IMPORTANT: 

To use your custom logo:

1. Save your logo image in this folder as "custom-logo.png" (or change the import in Logo.jsx if using a different filename/format)
2. For best results, use a square image with dimensions 200x200 pixels or larger
3. For transparency, PNG format with transparent background is recommended

To update the favicon as well:
1. Save a version of your logo in SVG or PNG format
2. Replace the file at "../../../public/favicon.svg" with your logo
